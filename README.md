Avogadro is an advanced molecular editor designed for cross-platform use in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, bioinformatics, materials science, and related areas. It offers flexible rendering and a powerful plugin architecture.

This repository is for the [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) version of Avogadro, which can be downloaded from [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/org.openchemistry.Avogadro2).

We also provide a `beta` branch of this Flatpak, which is kept up-to-date with the latest features and fixes; see [the Avogadro website](https://two.avogadro.cc/install/flatpak.html#beta) for instructions on setting it up.

Please only open issues here that specifically concern the Flatpak.
General bugs and feature requests should be opened at the [main repo](https://github.com/OpenChemistry/avogadrolibs) or posted on [our forum](https://discuss.avogadro.cc/).

Note that while the Avogadro source code is released under the BSD 3-Clause License, the Flatpak also contains the GPLv2-licensed [Open Babel](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel).
